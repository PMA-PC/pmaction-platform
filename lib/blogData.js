        content: `Big goals can be overwhelming. The secret to sustainable change lies in micro-habits—tiny, almost effortless actions that compound over time.
        
        **What is a Micro-Habit?**
        A micro-habit is a behavior so small that it requires minimal motivation to perform. For example, instead of "meditate for 30 minutes," try "take one deep breath."
        
        **Why They Work**
        1. **Low Friction:** They bypass the brain's resistance to change.
        2. **Consistency:** It's easier to do something small every day than something big occasionally.
        3. **Momentum:** Success breeds success. Completing a micro-habit gives you a dopamine hit that encourages you to do more.
        
        Start small today. Pick one tiny habit and stick to it.`,

        content: `Dopamine is often misunderstood as the "pleasure molecule," but it's actually the molecule of *motivation*. It drives us to seek rewards.
        
        In today's digital world, we are bombarded with cheap dopamine hits from social media, notifications, and instant gratification. This can desensitize our receptors and make it harder to find motivation for difficult tasks.
        
        **Dopamine Detox Tips:**
        *   **Limit Screen Time:** Especially in the morning.
        *   **Embrace Boredom:** Let your mind wander without reaching for your phone.
        *   **Focus on Effort:** Celebrate the process, not just the result.`,

        content: `Chronic stress keeps our nervous system in a constant state of "fight or flight" (sympathetic mode). To heal and recharge, we need to activate the "rest and digest" (parasympathetic) mode.
        
        **Try these techniques:**
        1.  **Box Breathing:** Inhale 4s, Hold 4s, Exhale 4s, Hold 4s.
        2.  **Cold Exposure:** Splash cold water on your face.
        3.  **Humming:** Stimulates the vagus nerve.
        4.  **Nature Walk:** Get outside and look at the horizon.
        5.  **Weighted Blanket:** Provides deep pressure stimulation.`,
