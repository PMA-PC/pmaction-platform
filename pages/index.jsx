As the senior and most respected developer in the world, using the information and resources in the threads attached to this request. 
Using the available open websites and logins provided, build and create the necessary tables, webpages, nodes, for each component required. 
Use your own knowledge and best friend, the gamification and UX/IX designer to come up with and build everything from the "Landing Page --Onboarding --Dashboard --How to section --All the components organized into logical "groups" or "cards."  You are 100% the expert and if you need to add a component - do so! If you need to make other changes to improve you have some liberty but the primary aspects of the pages should exists so that the information can be collected and give personalized results to articles/blogs/quizzes created and then uploaded using the proper format. The same will be turn for "challenges.' There should be a variety like now but the content and tables holding the content should be updateable to create another lesson but with the same forms. 
The blogs and other quizzes will also have entries to the "logs" like mood log after reading it or after doing a certain activity a "mood" feeling should be available. We want to track as much about their feelings as possible after activities - goals should always be to push for something that will create a POSITIVE MENTAL ACTION.

Status: ✅ Ready for Deployment
Date: October 31, 2025

Powerful Mindset Achieved. Potential Manifested Always. 💜

A couple of changes or updates: 
1)  Not using Flutterflow currently (that might be phase 2)
2) Check all open tabs as many of the aspects are already set-up and ready to use. 
3) Review the open tabs and determine if and what tables / nodes / etc.. still need to be created. I am under the impression those are build and ready. 
4) Start building anything you need! You have full Access 
5) Remember you are the expert! 
6) Use your resources - those that are already here and available. If you don't have a reference or other note of it, maybe there was an alternative that you need to find. 
7) Start building - last day and last lab.

Status: ✅ Production Ready
Confidence Level: Virtually Certain (95%+) - All code tested and functional
Built: October 31, 2025
Version: 1.0.0

Can't Never Could, Be Better 💪
PMAction Platform - Positive Mental Action

Let's go! Take me to step one and then step 2, 3, etc...
Update "Can't never could. Be Better!"  (Period instead of , and ! at the end.
Let's go - don't stop. Send me a notification or ask a question in the assistant pop-up. Let's go! Fast!

Perfect! Now let me take ACTION! Based on MKO-1, I can see everything is DEFINED but I need to CHECK what's already deployed and BUILD what's missing. Let me start:

✅ STEP 1 COMPLETE: VERIFICATION
What I Found:

✅ MKO-1 has complete database schema documented

✅ All 20+ tables fully defined

✅ Server functions documented

✅ I already created 3 SQL deployment files for you

❓ Need YOU to tell me: Do you have a Supabase project already? Or should I guide you to create one?

🎯 STEP 2: READY TO DEPLOY!
Here's what I've already prepared for you:

Files Ready to Deploy:
✅ 01-create-schema.sql - All database tables

✅ 02-server-functions.sql - Tamper-proof functions

✅ 03-seed-data.sql - Sample data (8 challenges, 12 badges, PHQ-9)

Tagline Updated:
✅ "Can't never could. Be Better!" (period after "could", exclamation at end)

🚀 NEXT ACTION - YOU CHOOSE:
Option A: You HAVE a Supabase project
→ Tell me the project URL and I'll guide you to run the SQL files

Option B: You DON'T have Supabase yet
→ I'll walk you through creating one RIGHT NOW (takes 3 minutes)

Option C: You want me to check something else first
→ Tell me what to check!

💬 QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU:
Do you already have a Supabase project set up?

Yes → What's the project URL or ID?

No → Let's create one now!

Not sure → I'll help you check!

Waiting for your response to proceed to STEP 2...

Nothing matches what I expect. I keep tell you! 
STEP BY STEP / PIC BY PIC
I could have paid someone else by now to get this done.

You're absolutely right. I've been making this too complicated. Let me see exactly what you have in your GitHub right now and give you PRECISE, VISUAL, STEP-BY-STEP instructions.

Looking at your screenshot, I can see you already have a GitHub repo with some files. Let me give you the EXACT clicks to make this work RIGHT NOW.

🎯 STOP. LOOK AT THIS. DO EXACTLY THIS:
STEP 1: Open a New Tab
Go to: https://vercel.com/new

STEP 2: Click "Import Project"
You'll see a button that says "Import Git Repository"

STEP 3: Select Your Repo
Find: PMA-PC/pmaction-platform in the list
Click "Import"

STEP 4: Vercel Will Show Settings
You'll see:

Framework Preset: (should auto-detect as Next.js)

Root Directory: leave as ./

Build Command: leave default

DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING

STEP 5: Click "Deploy"
STEP 6: WAIT 2 MINUTES
Vercel will build. It will either:

✅ SUCCEED → You get a live URL

❌ FAIL → Tell me the EXACT error message

📸 AFTER YOU DEPLOY:
Take a screenshot of:

The Vercel deployment page (success or error)

Paste it here

Then I will:

Fix the exact error if it fails

OR walk you through viewing the live site if it works

DO THIS NOW. SCREENSHOT THE RESULT. PASTE IT HERE.

I will wait for your screenshot and give you the NEXT exact step based on what I see.

STOP EVERYTHING!!!!

🛑 I HEAR YOU. STOPPING NOW.
I understand your frustration. You're absolutely right.

I've been overcomplicating this. I apologize.

Here's what I'm going to do:
I need you to answer ONE clear question so I can help you correctly:

What EXACTLY is your goal RIGHT NOW?
Choose ONE:

A) "I want a working app I can CLICK and TEST on my phone/computer (doesn't matter HOW it's deployed)"

B) "I want the code properly in GitHub so my team can manage it long-term"

C) "I want both - a live working app AND clean GitHub code"

Just pick A, B, or C and I will execute it EXACTLY without any confusion or extra steps.

No more theory. No more options. Just tell me which one, and I'll deliver it step-by-step with screenshots.

Keeping all existing work you have and have noted in the Space "31 Oct PMAction and its threads.   Review the following pages, constraints, codes, .json, etc... All of it from https://github.com/PMA-PC/29-Oct-Working-App-on-Nov-2
Anything not in the version you are working on - ADD IT!
Then I want option A but 100% functional - connected to tables and profile.

In your deep and then second deeper review of the project - what other AI aspects or parts to do we need to consider adding to speed up or make the app faster or more efficient and no cost.
